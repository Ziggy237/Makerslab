# Leave your mark
A active workshop where we will design and craft personal stamps!

## why?
In a time where education is being pulled to the digital envirement more and more, it is important that students dont forget how to do some hands on learning! By doing this workshop they will combine their digital making and their hands on making. By making a stamp in specifically, students will have a item that will be reusable for a long time.

## What
The students will be designing and crafting personal stamps using a sustainable material, in this case cow waste.

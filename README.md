# Leave your mark
A active workshop where we will design and craft personal stamps!

## why?
In a time where education is being pulled to the digital envirement more and more, it is important that students dont forget how to do some hands on learning! By doing this workshop they will combine their digital making and their hands on making. By making a stamp in specifically, students will have a item that will be reusable for a long time.

## What
The students will be designing and crafting personal stamps of one of their own pictures or own designs using free online converters and a physical sustainable wood-like material, in this case cow waste.

## Who, Where, How long

**Who:** The workshop is suited for students in advanced studies

**Where:** The workshop will be most suited for places equipped with lasercutters.

**How long:** The workshop will take approximately 90 minutes.

## Preperation
For this workshop, students will need a laptop with an internet connection and access to a laser cutter.

Additionally depending on what a student wants to make, they can bring either a digital photo or a digital design that can be turned into a svg to make a stamp out of.

## Extra info
If you want to make your own stamp we would suggest to just do it! No stamp is alike or made in the same way. With trial and error you will eventually make a stamp to your liking.

But if this is your first time crafting something physical with a laser cutter, dont worry, we still got some tips for you:

If you have access to the laser cutters in the HvA Makerslab, we recommend checking out their website for extra information:
